abstract: Privacy nutrition labels provide a way to understand an app's key data practices without reading the 
  long and hard-to-read privacy policies. Recently, the app distribution platforms for iOS(Apple) and Android(Google) 
  have implemented mandates requiring app developers to fill privacy nutrition labels highlighting their privacy practices 
  such as data collection, data sharing, and security practices. These privacy labels contain very fine-grained 
  information about the apps' data practices such as the data types and purposes associated with each data type. 
  This provides us with a unique vantage point from which we can understand apps' data practices at scale.
