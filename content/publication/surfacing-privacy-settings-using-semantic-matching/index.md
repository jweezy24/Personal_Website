abstract: Online services utilize privacy settings to provide users with control
  over their data. However, these privacy settings are often hard to locate,
  causing the user to rely on provider-chosen default values. In this work, we
  train privacy settings centric encoders and leverage them to create an
  interface that allows users to search for privacy settings using free-form
  queries. To achieve this, we create a custom Semantic Similarity dataset,
  which consists of real user queries covering various privacy settings. We then
  use this dataset to fine-tune the state of the art encoders. Using these
  fine-tuned encoders, we perform semantic matching between the user queries and
  the privacy settings to retrieve the most relevant setting. Finally, we also
  use these encoders to generate embeddings of privacy settings from the top 100
  websites and perform unsupervised clustering to learn about the online privacy
  settings types.
