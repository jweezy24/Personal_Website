I am a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Computer Sciences. My research interests consist of operating system privacy and security, user privacy, and hacking. I work with Suman Banerjee and Kassem Fawaz, my lab[(WI-PI Lab)](https://wiscprivacy.com/) is where I currently work and am loving the research we are doing!

I completed my masters and undergraduate degrees at Loyola University Chicago. There I majored in computer science and mathematics. I started doing research with my Loyola advisors when I was a Sophomore. I also completed my Masters degree there as well.
