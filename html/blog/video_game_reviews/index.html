      <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
      <p>
        Since I study computer science, I may interject some speculation about a topic I know about.
        However, my knowledge of game development is relatively small, and my speculations are just that.
        These reviews are a fun way to express my opinion and are only that.
        My knowledge of computer science should not give my statements about game development credibility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a novice web developer.
        I am not trained in JavaScript, CSS, or HTML.
        All HTML/CSS templates were found online.
        I also will never have advertisements on my site (hopefully); I feel that most review sites have abrasive ads that ruin the experience.
        I have built every aspect of this website.
        The server is sitting next to me as I write these reviews.
        Connectivity issues may exist for users who live outside the US. 
        My goal is not to make the website pretty; if you hate the formatting (which I know some will), know I understand, and I am not a web developer.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have taken the liberty and broken up each review into sections.
        Readers may skip around the review or read it in its entirety.
        I want to acomidate for the detailed readers and the readers that just want to skip to the end.
      </p>
      <p>
      Below is the general outline of each review.
      Each header can be treated as a section of the review and this page will introduce each section.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>
      The introduction will be my way of introducing the reader to the game.
      I will also discuss my own biases about the game that could influence an opinion that the reader should keep in mind when reading those sections.
      Overall, this section's length will depend highly on the game and could be long or short. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sound</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sound is one of the most important aspects of video games that can be overlooked.
        How a game sounds can ultimately make or break a user's experience and should therefore be assessed when discussing the quality of a video game.
        The headphones I use are the DT 770 Pro, of which I own the 80ohm variant.
        They are not the best headphones, as any audiophile will tell you, although I like them and they do a good job.
        I do not own an amplifier currently; I plan to get one in the future but, for now, I am ampless. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Visuals</strong></p>
      <p>
        Visuals are also essential when it comes to video games.
        I feel this does not need to be clarified; every reviewer under the sun has discussed visuals.
        I will attempt to discuss how the art style fits with the game and if the visuals added a layer of enjoyment to the game.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Story/Narrative</strong></p>
      <p>
        The story of a game will be discussed here.
        Writing and performences are important to take under consideration as bad writing or performence could break immersion.
        The narrative is important and should be discussed.
        I will try to avoid spoilers when discussing the narrative.
        Although, I will notify the reader if spoilers will be discussed.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
      <p>
        The most important part of a video game and what separates it from other forms of media is gameplay.
        I assume this section will commonly be the longest section and will discuss how the game is meant to be played and different game modes.
        Game feel is also substantial and will be discussed here as well.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Fun Factor</strong></p>
      <p>
        How fun a video game is rather subjective and may depend on other people to make the game fun.
        One of my biggest pet peeves is when a reviewer only likes a game while playing with friends.
        Some games are designed for groups of people and I will touch on that as well.
        Even so, I believe the single user experience should be discussed and have weight when determining how fun a video game is.
        How fun I think the game is will be subjective, but i will try to be as objective as possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rating</strong></p>
      <p>
        Where most people will skip to, the rating section will act as a summary of the above points and will be given a numerical value out of ten.
        I know some people hate that, however giving abstract ideas numerical value is my job and I also think it is fun.
        If I have enough readership, the numeric value could be used for data visualization or something else equally fun.
        I will do my best to justify the number given to each game. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        I would like my average review score to hover around 5 or 6.
        Thus, my ratings will likely be lower than what some readers are accustomed to.
        For those of you concerned about how to interpret a score, I offer a table below. 
      </p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Score</th>
          <th>Implication</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>Terrible game, do not even play if its free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Terrible game, may be a funny gag gift.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Bad game, has too many problems for most users to consider purchasing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>Bad game, is a finished product and is playable but sucks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>Below average game, not my cup of tea but some may enjoy the experience.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>Average game, you've probably seen this game before and know if youd like it or not.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>Slightly above average game, a decent game with some fun experiences if you like what you read you may enjoy it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>Good game, most people will have some fun with it and may be worth picking up.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>Great game, the experience was fun and the game is worth a purchase.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td>Almost a perfect game, not only is it fun but it may be your new favorite.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>Perfect game, if you haven't played it you are missing out and should feel bad about it.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
