      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>
        People like to make cars go fast. 
        Forza Horizon 4 wants to make racing games fun for car people and gamers who have never played a racing game. 
        I was one of those who had never touched a racing game before Forza. 
        I played Forza Horizon 3 years ago and have fond memories of that experience. 
        However, I know nothing about cars. 
        I own a handed-down Ford Fusion, and I get the oil changed by JiffyLube.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forza is a Microsoft product under the development of playground games. 
        The Forza Horizon games are known as arcade racers. 
        An arcade racer is an easier-to-digest form of a racing game. 
        Typically, racing games punish the player for not racing perfectly when bumping into a wall or not following the racing line. 
        Arcade racers don't care about how the player drives. 
        You still win if you somehow get first place and hit all the checkpoints but slam into every wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do I Like racing games? 
        Normally no. 
        I find them boring and repetitive. 
        However, the Forza Horizon series is fun. 
        It is enjoyable even though I know nothing about cars and driving. 
        This review will explore the breadth of content that Forza offers. 
        I will explain why making cars go fast can be fun and specifically how Forza makes it fun seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
      <p>
        Instead of breaking up the sounds and visuals into two categories like I did for Inscryption, I will formalize that discussion under a single category. 
        To begin, let me tell you about the sounds. 
        Everyone has heard that loud, supped-up Honda Civic from 2001 drive by their home or apartment and roll their eyes at how lame that person probably is. 
        Forza turns you into that guy in the Honda Civic because the cars sound phenomenal. 
        I loved how the engines sounded while racing; each manufacturer has a different and unique sound. 
        I did not know that before Forza; I thought an engine was an engine. 
        That is how good the cars sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music is nothing super special, just some fun radio music from different genres. 
        Nothing too memorable. 
        The voice acting was also nothing special; I do not remember any of the characters. 
        When considering the importance of voice acting and music with most titles, these criticisms could make a game terrible. 
        For Forza, it doesn't impact it too much. You do not play Forza for the story. 
        You play for cars. 
        Personally, the lack of good characters makes the experience less memorable and doesn't make me want to replay the game. 
        Although, there is enough post-game content to remedy needing to replay the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's talk about the visuals; they are fantastic! 
        The massive set pieces are excellent and extremely fun to play through. 
        The different environments are eye candy; when I played this game tired after a long day of work, the visuals quickly immersed me into the game. 
        The landscape is fun to transverse, and going from race to race is not egregious. 
        I forgot there was even fast travel because going from place to place was fun. 
        Overall, the visuals are fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cars are why people play these games and for a good reason. 
        They look fantastic and are incredibly customizable. 
        I could put an anime girl decal on my Ferrari and win the national championship while doing it. 
        And the decals look like they belong on the car! 
        Each car seems individually designed one by one; for a game with over 400 vehicles, it's a feat that the Forza team put so much detail into each car.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Story/Narrative</strong></p>
      <p>
        You are a driver who wants to become the champion in all types of races in Horizon. 
        There is nothing else. 
        If there was, I forgot about it because it was irrelevant. 
        Car go fast.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
      <p>
        The gameplay is fun. 
        I was pleasantly surprised at how great the cars feel to drive. 
        Now, the gameplay itself is not revolutionary. You go in a loop or a straight line and get first. 
        Where the complexity lies is once again in the cars. 
        Each car has a racing class; each class is defined by several variables about the car. 
        Difficulty also somewhat correlates to the vehicle's speed, but some features also define a car's class, like acceleration and launch. 
        Each race, you select the vehicle you would like to use, and all other vehicles are within the same class as your selected car. 
        The lower class of vehicles is easier to race (in my opinion) than the faster cars. 
        Everything you can think of that is part of a car is tunable. 
        I did not get too much into tuning because I don't know anything. 
        User-uploaded tunings with a rating that tells you if the tune is well-liked for people like me.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are six different types of races: street races, road races, cross country races, dirt races, drag races, and showcase races. 
        All races have other cars that better suit the type of race. 
        For example, an offroad vehicle is better for dirt races than road races. 
        Forza offers several of each type to complete before racing in the championship. 
        In the same way that the cars are customizable, the races are all customizable. 
        You can make your own tracks or download other users' tracks. 
        I did not play around with this feature, but it is there for those who would enjoy it. 
        However, the ways I tried from players online were not fantastic and usually were designed to maximize profit and allow the player to have an easy win. 
        These tracks were convenient because eventually, you will need to grind credits and experience late-game rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you have done everything, what is left? 
        Forza has this massively addictive feature where a player spins a slot machine to get rewards after a level up completing a challenge. 
        The slot machines are dangerous; you will get hooked on this feature if you have a gambling problem. 
        I, for one, kept playing after I beat everything to ascertain more of these wheel spins. 
        There are also super wheel spins which are the same thing as a regular wheel spin, but you win three prizes at once rather than one. 
        The end game is spent doing online playlists of races to get an exclusive season car. 
        I am not a skilled racer, so I knew I would get trounced the second I raced online. 
        Therefore, the endgame revolved around attempting to get as many wheel spins as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides racing, there are online game modes that are unique to Horizon. 
        Eliminator, Horizon's take on a battle royal is actually quite fun. 
        It offers an excellent way to try out cars on the fly. 
        Players housing and businesses are also purchasable on the map to earn a passive income while you play. 
        Overall there are things to do in Forza, and one should not have any trouble finding something to do.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rating</strong></p>
      <p>
        I give the game a 7/10; it's above average. 
        The non-existent story hampers the single-player experience, and grinding credits for cars that you want becomes tedious. 
        Although the immense detail in the car's design is impressive, I would probably give the game a higher score if I were a car guy. 
        A six is not a bad score, and I would still recommend that you try it for yourself.
