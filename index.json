I am privileged to be advised by Professors Suman Banerjee and Kassem Fawaz, and I am a member of the cutting-edge WI-PI Lab performing bias and privacy research on machine learning algorithms.\nI first studied at Loyola University Chicago, where I completed both my undergraduate and master’s degrees. I have a solid foundation in mathematics, with an emphasis on algebraic topics such as group theory, Galois theory, and topology. Although these mathematical fields were fascinating, my focus has always been computer science.\nDuring my time at Loyola, I worked in cryptography, security, and privacy. Over the years, my interests have evolved, leading me to shift from cryptography to more focus on privacy in my research at UW-Madison. My prior advisors were Neil Klingensmith and George K. Thiruvathukal. Without them my computer science career would have never become what it is today.\n","date":1739923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1739923200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, my research delves deep into the nuances of operating system privacy and security, user privacy, and computer vision.
