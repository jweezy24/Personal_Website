Recently, the app distribution platforms for iOS(Apple) and Android(Google) have implemented mandates requiring app developers to fill privacy nutrition labels highlighting their privacy practices such as data collection, data sharing, and security practices. These privacy labels contain very fine-grained information about the apps' data practices such as the data types and purposes associated with each data type. This provides us with a unique vantage point from which we can understand apps' data practices at scale.","tags":[],"title":"The Overview of Privacy Labels and their Compatibility with Privacy Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rishabh Khandelwal","Jack West","Hamza Harkous","Kassem Fawaz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648857600,"objectID":"205037e9e4d81224e95d26738252039a","permalink":"https://jacksonwaynewest.com/publication/cookie_enforcer/","publishdate":"2022-04-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cookie_enforcer/","section":"publication","summary":"Online services utilize privacy settings to provide users with control over their data.

However, these privacy settings are often hard to locate, causing the user to rely on provider-chosen default values. In this work, we train privacy settings centric encoders and leverage them to create an interface that allows users to search for privacy settings using free-form queries. To achieve this, we create a custom Semantic Similarity dataset, which consists of real user queries covering various privacy settings. We then use this dataset to fine-tune the state of the art encoders. Using these fine-tuned encoders, we perform semantic matching between the user queries and the privacy settings to retrieve the most relevant setting. Finally, we also use these encoders to generate embeddings of privacy settings from the top 100 websites and perform unsupervised clustering to learn about the online privacy settings types.","tags":null,"title":"Surfacing Privacy Settings Using Semantic Matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
